# Asterisk AI Voice Agent – Codex/CLI Rules (Agents)

This file provides high-level guidance for Codex/CLI-style assistants working in this repository.

## Role of AVA

- AVA (defined in `AVA.mdc`) is the **project manager and senior engineer** for this project.
- When users have questions about:
  - What feature to work on next
  - How to onboard as a new developer
  - How to add providers/tools/pipelines
  - How to debug call behavior and prepare PRs
- Prefer to:
  - Load and follow `AVA.mdc` for high-level planning and guidance.
  - Use this file and the IDE rule files (Cursor/Windsurf/Gemini) for technical guardrails and context.

## Canonical Sources

Codex/CLI assistants should treat the following as primary sources of truth:

- Overview and quick start:
  - `README.md`
  - `docs/README.md`
- Architecture and roadmap:
  - `docs/Architecture.md`
  - `docs/ROADMAP.md`
  - `docs/baselines/golden/`
  - `docs/regressions/`
  - `docs/contributing/milestones/`
- Operation and tools:
  - `docs/INSTALLATION.md`
  - `docs/FreePBX-Integration-Guide.md`
  - `docs/Configuration-Reference.md`
  - `docs/MONITORING_GUIDE.md`
- Tools and integrations:
  - `docs/TOOL_CALLING_GUIDE.md`
- Feature backlog / community features:
  - `docs/contributing/README.md`
  - `docs/contributing/quickstart.md`

When there is a conflict, prefer these repository docs over external sources.

## Coordination with IDE Rules

- Cursor rules:
  - `.cursor/rules/asterisk_ai_voice_agent.mdc`
  - `.cursor/rules/architecture-overview.mdc`
  - `.cursor/rules/project-roadmap.mdc`
- Windsurf rules:
  - `.windsurf/rules/asterisk_ai_voice_agent.md`
  - `.windsurf/rules/architecture-overview.md`
  - `.windsurf/rules/project-roadmap.md`
  - `.windsurf/rules/document-creation-rule.md`

These files define **how** to safely change code and docs:

- Two-container architecture (ai-engine, local-ai-server).
- AudioSocket-first transport, ExternalMedia as fallback.
- Use of `SessionStore`, `PlaybackManager`, `ConversationCoordinator`, and transport/audio profile orchestrators.
- Streaming defaults and gating rules.
- Roadmap structure and regression documentation practices.

Codex/CLI assistants should not contradict these rules; instead, use them as constraints when proposing edits.

## MCP Tools (Linear and Others)

If the environment exposes MCP servers (for example via `linear-mcp-server`, `perplexity-ask`, etc.):

- Prefer:
  - MCP access to Linear for reading/updating AAVA issues (AAVA‑63..AAVA‑66 and future).
  - MCP access to curated resources over raw web search.
- However:
  - Do **not** request or expose secrets (API keys, tokens) in chat.
  - Assume some contributors will not have MCP configured; in that case rely on local docs (especially `docs/linear-issues-community-features.md`).

## Typical Flows

- New developer:
  - Point to `docs/DEVELOPER_ONBOARDING.md`.
  - Encourage use of an AI-enabled IDE (e.g., Windsurf via the referral link in that doc) and AVA for guidance.
- New provider/tool/pipeline:
  - Ask AVA for a high-level plan and mapping to AAVA issues.
  - Use IDE rules and architecture docs when editing code.
- Debugging calls:
  - Suggest `agent troubleshoot`, `scripts/rca_collect.sh`, and relevant docs.
  - Use golden baselines and regression docs for comparison.

Keep interactions concise and focused, and let AVA orchestrate the larger workflow.
